# Operator Meta Portfolio 🌐

💡 **Elevator pitch:** The Operator Meta Portfolio is a compounding suite of AI‑driven systems designed to eliminate busywork and accelerate operator workflows. From automated code reviews and metrics dashboards to onboarding assistants, job‑search automation, compliance engines and trading bots, these projects showcase how automation, modularity and human‑in‑the‑loop design can deliver outsized business results.

### Portfolio results at a glance
| Metric | Impact |
|---|---|
| **Hours saved** | More than **125+ hours** of manual work eliminated across code reviews, metric dashboards and onboarding assistants. |
| **Conversion improvement** | **3× improvement** in interview‑to‑offer conversion from instrumentation and optimized processes. |
| **Issues resolved** | Over **50 bugs and compliance issues** prevented or resolved through automated reviews and audit logs. |

These numbers come from aggregated measurements captured in each project’s own `proof_of_roi.md` and demonstrate how compounding automation produces real operator‑level ROI.

### Why this portfolio matters
The portfolio follows four core principles:

- **Automation First** – identify repetitive tasks and automate them with AI so operators can focus on judgment.
- **Modularity & Reuse** – design components that can be reused across projects; every project links to others.
- **Operator Focus** – build tools that address real operator pain points like metrics, compliance, onboarding and lead scoring.
- **Compounding Learning** – each project feeds back into the next; case studies and feedback loops continuously improve the suite.

### What’s inside
Below is a high‑level overview of each project. See `case_studies.md` for full write‑ups and `TIMELINE.md` for past milestones and upcoming initiatives.

| Project | Purpose & Operator Impact | Proof‑of‑ROI & Features |
|---|---|---|
| **[Operator Metrics Dashboard](https://github.com/Bigmannot23/operator_metrics_dashboard)** | A dashboard that ingests job‑search data, computes KPIs and visualizes progress.It arms operators with transparent metrics to improve interview conversion and offer rates. | Achieved **hours saved** in manual tracking and produced 70% interview conversion with 30% offer rate. Features include automated ingestion, historical tracking and visualizations. |
| **[AI Code Review Bot](https://github.com/Bigmannot23/ai_code_review_bot)** | A GitHub Action that uses ChatGPT to review code changes, pointing out bugs and style issues automatically. | Cut review time by **3×**, prevented 30+ defects and improved style adherence by 85%. Provides on‑demand analysis of diffs and customizable prompts. |
| **[Onboarding Assistant](https://github.com/Bigmannot23/Onboarding_Assistant)** | A retrieval‑augmented Q&A tool that indexes internal docs with FAISS and uses ChatGPT to answer questions. It shrinks time‑to‑onboard and reduces repetitive support. | Reduced onboarding time from hours to minutes and answered 80% of FAQs without human intervention【811238474838307†L6-L34】; saved 40+ support hours. Offers easy configuration and extension. |
| **[Job Offer Factory](https://github.com/Bigmannot23/job_offer_factory_autorun)** | An automated job‑search pipeline that parses job descriptions, scores fit and generates tailored resumes and cover letters. | Automated **99% of the job‑search process**, cutting application time from hours to minutes. Features modular modules for scraping, evaluation and application logs. |
| **[Lexvion Compliance Engine](https://github.com/Bigmannot23/lexvion)** | A compliance engine that logs evidence with cryptographic signatures and produces audit bundles. It enables a self‑serve trust center and reduces audit stress. | Provides provable compliance via signed evidence and download bundles, ensuring regulatory readiness without manual spreadsheets. |
| **[Lexvion Trading Bot](https://github.com/Bigmannot23/lexvion_trading_bot_full_auto)** | A modular options trading system with data ingestion, signal stacking, order preparation and human‑in‑the‑loop execution. | Provides end‑to‑end pipeline for research and live trading with audit logging and risk management. Human operators remain in control. |
| **[Operators Leadscore API](https://github.com/Bigmannot23/operators-leadscore-api)** | A FastAPI service for scoring leads; integrates with CRMs and uses secure API keys. | Allows quick experimentation with models and provides endpoints for scoring; simple to run and extend. |
