# AlexanderÂ LeeÂ Minnick â€“ Metaâ€‘Tier Portfolio

## ðŸš€ AIâ€‘First Builder & Operator

Iâ€™m **Alexander LeeÂ Minnick** (aka **Bigmannot23**), a 21â€‘yearâ€‘old founder/operator obsessed with compounding automation.  I build and ship endâ€‘toâ€‘end systems that eliminate busywork, unlock leverage, and deliver measurable business impact.  Without a formal CS degree, Iâ€™ve already shipped multiple productionâ€‘grade productsâ€”from jobâ€‘search pipelines and trading bots to compliance engines and leadâ€‘scoring APIs.  My philosophy is simple:

> **Operate like a founder.  Automate like an AI.  Execute like itâ€™s the only shot you get.**

### What sets me apart

- **Endâ€‘toâ€‘end ownership:** I identify opportunities, design modular architectures, code, ship, and document for operators and auditors.
- **Business impact over code:** Every project solves a real problem and produces measurable results (time saved, risk reduced, revenue potential).
- **AIâ€‘first automation:** I treat AI models and automation as core components, not afterthoughts.  Prompt engineering and LLM integration are built into my pipelines.
- **Compounding learning:** Each system is modular and documented so it can be reused, forked, and improvedâ€”sharpening the next project.
 - **Instrumented systems:** I build live dashboards (e.g. the OperatorÂ MetricsÂ Dashboard) that track conversion rates and hours saved, proving the ROI of my automation.

## ðŸ“ˆ Total ROI â€“ Quick Stats

Automation is only valuable when it delivers measurable outcomes.  Across my systems I track and report the following aggregate metrics (updated via scripts and GitHub Actions):

- **Total hours saved:** **125+** hours eliminated from manual workflows (applications, code reviews, onboarding).
- **Conversion improvements:** **3Ã—** uplift in key funnels (job interviews, PR approvals, onboarding rampâ€‘up).
- **Defects/questions resolved:** Over **50** bugs and inquiries addressed autonomously.

See [`proof_of_roi.md`](proof_of_roi.md) for a detailed breakdown of these numbers and the methodology behind them.

## ðŸ“‚ Case Studies

Below are brief case studies of my most impactful projects.  Each demonstrates how I combine systems thinking, AI, and automation to deliver tangible results.  See `case_studies.md` for the full narratives.

| Project | Problem & Opportunity | Operator Solution | Business Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **JobÂ OfferÂ FactoryÂ Autorun** | Job hunting is tedious and inconsistent. | Built a pipeline that tailors resumes, generates personalized outreach, fires off LinkedIn DMs, and tracks progress. | Automated 99Â % of my own jobâ€‘search process in under 3Â hours; framework reusable for any candidate. |
| **LexvionÂ TradingÂ Bot (FullÂ Auto)** | Manual options trading is errorâ€‘prone and lacks risk controls. | Architected a modular bot that ingests market data, stacks signals, manages risk, and executes trades autonomously. | Demonstrated endâ€‘toâ€‘end quant pipeline; foundation for future algorithms and potential revenue streams. |
| **LexvionÂ ComplianceÂ Engine** | Compliance processes are manual, scattered, and opaque. | Created a complianceâ€‘byâ€‘default SaaS combining GPTâ€‘4 and Ed25519 signatures to autoâ€‘generate reports and maintain audit trails. | Converts compliance into a competitive advantage; reduces manual effort and ensures audit readiness. |
| **LeadsCoreÂ API** | Sales teams waste time on lowâ€‘quality leads. | Developed an API that scores leads and enriches data using ML and external sources. | Enables marketers to focus on highâ€‘value prospects; integrates easily into existing CRMs. |
| **OperatorÂ MetricsÂ Dashboard** | Job search pipelines are opaque and hard to optimize. | Built a Streamlit dashboard that ingests job application data, computes key metrics, and updates automatically via GitHub Actions. | Quantifies conversion rates and hours saved, proving the ROI of automation and my operator mindset. |

## ðŸ§  About / Bio

See `about_bio.md` for a longâ€‘form bio.  In short: Iâ€™m a selfâ€‘taught automation architect, founder, and builder.  I operate at a senior level by shipping operatorâ€‘grade products and frameworks that compound over time.
