# About / Bio – Senior Level

I’m **Alexander Lee Minnick**, a self‑taught builder and operator who thrives at the intersection of AI, automation, and business impact.  At 21, I’ve already founded **Lexvion Solutions** and shipped multiple production‑ready systems that automate job search, trading, compliance, and lead scoring.  My work isn’t about showing off technology—it’s about eliminating friction, compounding learning, and unlocking leverage for myself and anyone who adopts my systems.

## A builder and operator first

- **Builder:** I design and code from the ground up.  Whether it’s a trading bot or a SaaS platform, I own the architecture, implementation, and deployment.  My tools are modern (Python, TypeScript, FastAPI, Node.js), but the guiding principles are timeless: modular design, clear interfaces, and composability.
- **Operator:** I’m not satisfied until a system works in the real world.  My Job Offer Factory and compliance engine aren’t academic exercises—people can fork them and achieve immediate results.  Every project comes with clear READMEs, operator checklists, and audit‑ready documentation.
- **Automation architect:** I view AI and automation as extensions of human capability.  I build pipelines that augment decision‑makers, free up human focus for higher‑order tasks, and capture compounding benefits over time.

## Proof of work at senior scale

- **Shipped 4+ production systems** before turning 22, each delivering measurable business impact.
- **Automated 99 % of my own job search**, proving that leverage isn’t just theoretical.
- **Built modular pipelines** reused across trading, recruiting, and SaaS compliance, demonstrating a meta‑level view of system design.
- **Operate at founder pace**—from ideation to deployment in days, not quarters.

## Why I’m different

Most candidates list technologies; I list outcomes.  I treat every project as a mini business: define the problem, build the system, measure the impact, document the process, and then extract reusable components.  I thrive in environments where speed, leverage, and business impact matter more than pedigree.

I’m looking to collaborate with teams and founders who value builders with a bias for action—people who aren’t afraid to automate themselves out of a job, because it means they can move on to bigger challenges.
