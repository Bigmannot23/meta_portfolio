# Action Checklist – Launching Your Meta‑Tier Portfolio

Follow these prioritized steps to maximize visibility and impact when deploying your new portfolio.  The first items deliver the highest immediate return.

## ✅ Immediate Actions

1. **Update GitHub Profile README**
   - Replace your current GitHub profile README with the content from `meta_portfolio/README.md`.
   - Link to `case_studies.md` and `about_bio.md` within the repository for deeper dives.

2. **Build & Publish Personal Site**
   - Use the content from `meta_portfolio/README.md`, `about_bio.md`, and `case_studies.md` to create a simple portfolio site (e.g., via GitHub Pages, Notion, or a static site generator).
   - Apply your Lexvion color scheme and logo throughout.
   - Include a “Target Roles” section and your live dashboards (if ready).

3. **Refresh LinkedIn Profile**
   - Update your LinkedIn “About” section using the provided copy in `linkedin_summary.md`.
   - Pin a post announcing your new portfolio and link to your personal site and GitHub README.
   - Add the condensed bio to your headline or summary.

4. **Send Introductory Messages**
   - Use the DM/email template in `linkedin_summary.md` to reach out to recruiters, founders, and peers.  Personalize the greeting and mention specific roles of interest.

## 📅 Short‑Term Enhancements (Week 1–2)

5. **Embed the Operator Metrics Dashboard**
   - The Operator Metrics Dashboard is already built and included in this portfolio.  Publish it via Streamlit Cloud or embed it on your personal site to showcase conversion rates and automation ROI.
   - Ensure the GitHub Action is active to refresh metrics automatically.  For other dashboards (like trading performance), follow a similar pattern.

6. **Publish Operator READMEs**
   - Add detailed operator guides for each major project, explaining setup, configuration, and extension points.
   - Link them in your GitHub repositories and portfolio site.

7. **Set Up Custom Domain**
   - Purchase a domain (e.g., alexminnick.com or lexvion.ai) and point it to your portfolio site for a professional touch.

## 🚀 Longer‑Term Impact (Month 1+)

8. **Aggregate ROI Metrics**
   - Collect usage data and user feedback from those who adopt your systems (e.g., job search outcomes, trading bot performance).
   - Publish a “proof‑of‑ROI” block summarizing time saved, conversion improvements, and other impact metrics.

9. **Host a Webinar or AMA**
   - Organize a live session showcasing your systems and answering questions about automation, AI, and compounding workflows.
   - Record the session and embed highlights on your site and LinkedIn.

10. **Iterate and Expand**
   - Continuously refine your projects based on feedback.
   - Add new case studies as you ship new systems.
   - Keep your content fresh to maintain search engine and recruiter interest.
