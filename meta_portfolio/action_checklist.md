# Action Checklist â€“ Using Your Dashboard

Follow this checklist each time you update your job-search data or review the dashboard.

- [ ] Gather the latest application data and add it to the `data/` folder.
- [ ] Run the ingestion script/notebook to refresh metrics.
- [ ] Review key KPIs: interview conversion rate, offer rate, time to decision, and throughput.
- [ ] Identify bottlenecks (e.g., low conversion at screening) and note hypotheses.
- [ ] Adjust your job-search strategy (applications, resume tailoring, outreach) based on insights.
- [ ] Update `config_example.json` with new thresholds or metrics if your goals change.
- [ ] Log changes and decisions in `timeline.md` to track what actions lead to improvements.
