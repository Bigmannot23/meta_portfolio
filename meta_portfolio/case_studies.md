# Project Case Studies

Each case study distills a real business problem, the operator‑grade solution I delivered, and the resulting impact.  These summaries are written for decision‑makers who care about outcomes, not just technology.

## 🎯 Job Offer Factory Autorun

**Problem / Opportunity:** Job search is tedious and inefficient.  Candidates spend hours customizing resumes, writing cover letters, sending messages, and tracking responses—with inconsistent results.

**Solution:** I built an end‑to‑end pipeline that automates 99 % of the job‑hunting process.  The system:

- Scrapes job postings and matches them to the candidate’s experience.
- Generates tailored resumes and cover letters using LLMs and dynamic templates.
- Sends personalized outreach via LinkedIn and email with follow‑up scheduling.
- Tracks all activities in a unified dashboard for monitoring and analytics.

**Business Impact:** Reduced my personal job‑application time from hours to minutes, achieving 99 % automation.  The pipeline can be forked and adapted by other job seekers or recruitment agencies to dramatically improve application throughput and response rates.

## 📈 Lexvion Trading Bot (Full Auto)

**Problem / Opportunity:** Retail and professional traders often execute options strategies manually, leading to missed signals, poor risk management, and emotional decisions.

**Solution:** Architected a modular, fully automated options‑trading bot that:

- Ingests real‑time market data and news.
- Stacks multiple technical and sentiment signals to generate buy/sell triggers.
- Implements risk controls (position sizing, stop‑loss, profit targets) and diversification.
- Executes trades via brokerage APIs and logs results in a dashboard.

**Business Impact:** Demonstrates a scalable approach to algorithmic trading.  By automating data ingestion, signal generation, and execution, the bot lays the groundwork for quantitative funds or personal traders seeking to remove emotion and enforce risk discipline.  The modular architecture allows for rapid strategy iteration.

## 🛡️ Lexvion Compliance Engine

**Problem / Opportunity:** Many SaaS and AI products struggle with compliance obligations (privacy laws, data audits).  Processes are often manual, scattered across spreadsheets, and prone to error.

**Solution:** Developed a compliance‑by‑default platform that:

- Uses GPT‑4 and natural language prompts to interpret regulations and generate compliance checklists.
- Embeds Ed25519 digital signatures into data flows to ensure tamper‑proof audit trails.
- Provides dashboards and alerts for operators to monitor compliance posture in real time.
- Generates exportable reports for regulators or clients on demand.

**Business Impact:** Transforms compliance from a cost center into a competitive advantage.  The system reduces manual compliance work, ensures audit readiness, and builds customer trust through transparency.  Early adopters can save legal fees and avoid fines while focusing on product development.

## 🎯 LeadsCore API

**Problem / Opportunity:** Sales and marketing teams waste resources chasing unqualified leads.  Traditional scoring models are static and lack enrichment.

**Solution:** Created a B2B lead‑scoring and enrichment API that:

- Accepts minimal lead information (name, company, email) and enriches it using third‑party data sources.
- Applies machine‑learning classifiers to predict conversion likelihood.
- Returns both a numerical score and enriched firmographic data for personalization.

**Business Impact:** Enables sales teams to prioritize high‑value prospects and personalize outreach.  Early tests show reduced time spent on poor‑quality leads and improved conversion rates.  The API integrates seamlessly into CRMs and marketing automation tools.

## 📊 Operator Metrics Dashboard

**Problem / Opportunity:** Job search automation pipelines can generate dozens of applications and follow‑ups per week, but without instrumentation it’s hard to know what’s working.  Candidates and recruiters lack visibility into conversion rates, interview ratios, and time savings.

**Solution:** I created a Streamlit‑based dashboard that ingests job application data (JSON or spreadsheet), computes key metrics (applications, interviews, offers, DMs, follow‑ups, conversion rates, hours saved), and presents them in an interactive UI.  A companion script (`update_data.py`) appends metrics snapshots to a history file and a GitHub Action runs the script on a schedule, keeping the dashboard continuously up to date.

**Business Impact:** The dashboard provides instant insight into the effectiveness of my Job Offer Factory pipeline.  By tracking conversion rates and time saved, it quantifies the ROI of automation and guides iteration.  The automated update pipeline shows that I close the loop between execution and analytics—an essential skill for any high‑impact operator.
