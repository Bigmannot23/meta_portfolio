## LinkedIn “About” Section

> **AI‑First Builder & Operator | Founder @ Lexvion Solutions | Automation Architect**
>
> I’m Alexander Lee Minnick (Bigmannot23), a self‑taught developer and operator who designs AI‑driven systems that eliminate busywork and unlock leverage.  Before turning 22 I shipped multiple production‑grade products—from a job‑search pipeline that automated 99 % of my application process to a fully automated options‑trading bot and a compliance‑by‑default SaaS platform.  I believe the future belongs to those who operate like founders, automate like AI, and execute like it’s their only shot.  Let’s build it together.

> **Key strengths:** prompt engineering · automation pipelines · full‑stack development (Python/TypeScript) · quant trading · compliance & security · operator‑grade documentation.
>
> **Current focus:** connecting with founders and teams who value speed, leverage, and measurable business impact.  Open to AI prompt engineering, automation architecture, founding engineer roles, and quant research/development opportunities.

## Short DM / Email Intro

> I’m Alex Minnick, founder of Lexvion Solutions and a self‑taught AI automation architect.  I’ve built systems that automate job search (99 % automation), trading strategies, compliance workflows, and lead scoring—each with clear business impact.  I operate at a founder’s pace and love turning manual processes into compounding assets.  If you’re looking for someone who can design, build, and ship AI‑powered automation that drives real results, I’d love to chat.
