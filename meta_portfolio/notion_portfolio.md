## Hero Section

**Alexander Lee Minnick (Bigmannot23)** – AI‑first builder, operator, and founder of **Lexvion Solutions**.  I design systems that automate complex workflows and deliver real business impact.  My guiding mantra:

> **Operate like a founder.  Automate like an AI.  Execute like it’s the only shot you get.**

## Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Automation First** | Identify repetitive tasks and build systems that eliminate them. |
| **Modularity & Reuse** | Architect components that can be recombined across domains—job search, trading, compliance. |
| **Operator Focus** | Provide clear READMEs, dashboards, and audit trails so others can run the system with confidence. |
| **Compounding Learning** | Each project feeds the next; lessons learned accelerate progress. |

## Case Studies

### Job Offer Factory Autorun

**Problem:** Manual job search is inefficient and inconsistent.  
**Solution:** Built a pipeline that generates tailored resumes, personalized outreach, and tracks applications end‑to‑end.  
**Impact:** Automated 99 % of my own job search in <3 hours; reusable framework for others.

### Lexvion Trading Bot (Full Auto)

**Problem:** Manual options trading lacks consistent risk management.  
**Solution:** Developed a modular bot that ingests market data, runs multiple strategy modules, manages risk, and executes trades automatically.  
**Impact:** Provides an institutional‑grade quant pipeline accessible to individuals and small funds.

### Lexvion Compliance Engine

**Problem:** Compliance processes are time‑consuming and opaque.  
**Solution:** Created a compliance‑by‑default SaaS using GPT‑4 and Ed25519 signatures to generate audit‑ready reports.  
**Impact:** Reduces compliance overhead and turns regulation into a competitive edge.

### LeadsCore API

**Problem:** Sales teams waste time on unqualified leads.  
**Solution:** Built an AI‑powered API to score and enrich leads with firmographic data.  
**Impact:** Improves conversion rates by prioritizing high‑quality prospects.

### Operator Metrics Dashboard

**Problem:** Automation can produce hundreds of applications, DMs, and follow‑ups—but without instrumentation, it’s impossible to know what’s working.
**Solution:** Built a Streamlit dashboard that ingests job application data, computes conversion rates (applications → interviews → offers), tracks DMs and follow‑ups, and estimates hours saved by automation.  A GitHub Action updates the metrics history automatically.
**Impact:** Quantifies the ROI of my job‑search automation and demonstrates a closed feedback loop.  Helps decide where to double down and shows recruiters the efficiency of my pipeline.

## Target Roles & Fit

- **AI Prompt Engineer / LLM Interaction Engineer:** Craft prompts and workflows around large language models; proven through job‑search and compliance systems.
- **Automation Specialist / RPA Developer:** Build code and no‑code automations; demonstrated across multiple pipelines.
- **AI Operations Assistant / Virtual AI Assistant:** Integrate AI tools into team workflows; comfortable documenting and training users.
- **Founding Engineer (AI) / Full‑Stack Developer:** End‑to‑end product ownership; shipped multiple SaaS products before age 22.
