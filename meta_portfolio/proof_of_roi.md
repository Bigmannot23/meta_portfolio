# Proof of ROI â€“ Aggregated Impact

This document aggregates measurable outcomes across all my projects.  These numbers are placeholders; replace them with your own data as you gather realâ€‘world feedback.

## ðŸ“Š Key Metrics

| Metric | OperatorÂ MetricsÂ Dashboard | AIÂ CodeÂ ReviewÂ Bot | OnboardingÂ Assistant | Cumulative |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Hours saved** | 75+ hours of manual application work eliminated | 20+ reviewer hours saved per month | 30+ mentor hours saved per hire | **125+** hours saved |
| **Conversion improvement** | Interview rate increased from 5Â % to 15Â % | Higher quality code merged on first pass | New hire productivity within 3 days instead of 7 | **3Ã— average improvement** |
| **Defects prevented / Questions answered** | N/A | 10+ bugs/security issues caught monthly | 40+ questions answered autonomously | **50+ issues/questions resolved** |
| **Time to decision / rampâ€‘up** | Offers received 2 weeks faster | Pull requests reviewed within minutes | Onboarding time cut by half | **Significant reduction across the board** |

## ðŸ§¾ Methodology

- **Hours saved** for the dashboard are derived from the `hours_saved_by_automation` field in `applications.json`.  For the code review bot and onboarding assistant, estimate the average time saved per event and multiply by usage counts.
- **Conversion improvement** compares key funnel metrics before and after automation.  For example, the dashboard measures interviews/applications; the onboarding assistant measures days to productivity.
- **Defects prevented / Questions answered** counts the number of issues surfaced by the bot and the number of queries resolved without human intervention.
- **Time to decision / rampâ€‘up** measures how long it takes to get to a key outcome (job offer, PR merged, fully onboarded) before vs. after automation.

## ðŸ“Œ Interpretation

These figures tell a story of compounding leverage.  By automating highâ€‘friction processes and instrumenting them, I not only free up dozens of hours per monthâ€”I accelerate cycles of feedback and decisionâ€‘making.  When multiplied across an organization, these savings translate into faster hiring, higher quality software, and happier team members.
